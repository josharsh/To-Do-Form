# To-Do-Form
This repository contains the assignment work for the Radicali Web development Internship. 

## Task:
To build a form to create a To-Do for a Task Manager. The specs are as follows:
* The To-Do shall have a "Title", "Description", "Due Date", and "Status" field.
* Title & Description are required fields, others are optional.
* The "Status" field should be able to select one of the following: "ToDo", "Ongoing", "Stalled", or "Done".
* The "Due Date" should allow the user to select a particular date from a calendar.
* The form should have a "Save" button, when clicked -- it should redirect me to a confirmation page with the specific details of the to-do shown there.
